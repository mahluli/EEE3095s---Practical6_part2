The code is the sensor Node, meaning it will sampling a temperature sensor as well as the light
dependent resistor, both will be connected on a ADC to convert the analogue signals to digital
signals, and this sampling will be in each and every 10 seconds. The sensor node will also have a
responsibility to transmit those samples using a TCP network connect.
